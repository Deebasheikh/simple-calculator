1.Description:
This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, when run in a terminal or command prompt environment. It provides users with a straightforward way to perform simple arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using text-based input and output.

2.Features:

Arithmetic Operations:

Supports standard arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

User-Friendly Interface:

Utilizes a text-based interface for user interaction, displaying prompts and results directly in the command line.

Error Handling:

Implements error handling to gracefully manage scenarios such as invalid input, providing clear error messages to the user.
 

3. Purpose:
The CLI Simple Calculator serves as a lightweight and versatile tool for performing basic mathematical calculations quickly and efficiently within a command line interface. 

4. Implementation:
Implemented using a programming language and some packages such as typescript,node.js,inquirer and chalk. The CLI Simple Calculator leverages basic input/output operations to interact with users via the command line by using inquirer and usage of chalk make the calculator more attractive.
